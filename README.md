# Security of Wireless Networks

This documents is a summary for the course *Security of Wireless Networks (SOWN)* at ETH Zurich.

This summary was originally created during the autumn semester 2020.
But due to the few changes in syllabus content in the past we have reason to believe that it is also
relevant beyond that very semester. 

We do not guarantee correctness or completeness, nor is this document endorsed by the lecturers.  
Feel free to point out any erratas.
