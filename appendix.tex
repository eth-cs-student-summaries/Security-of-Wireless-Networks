\section{Imprint}

This document closely follows the lecture slides of the \textit{Security of Wireless Networks} lecture in the autumn semester 2020 at ETH Zurich.
Our contribution to this is editing the whole lot and refactoring even more so that it may fit the "lecture summary" style.
However, basically all graphics are copy \& pasted from the slides. If you don't want yours here, please contact us and we will remove them.

In addition, this summary is based on a summary by Sarah Kamp.

Otherwise, our part of the work is published as CC BY-NC-SA.
