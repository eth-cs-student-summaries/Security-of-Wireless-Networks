\section{Jamming-Resistant Broadcast}

\paragraph{Broadcast Communication}
One sender, many receivers.
Inherently open: receivers may join and leave at any time.
\underline{All} receivers listen (c.f. multicast).
E.g. radio (FM/AM), GPS.

Challenges when securing broadcast:  \\
many and unknown receivers, colluding receivers, internal + external attackers.
In particular, plain spreading techniques (with group keys) do not work -- an interal attacker can use their knowledge to jam other receivers.

\paragraph{Based on FHSS}
Broadcast Anti-Jamming System due to Desmedt et al. \\
Base station transmits on multiple frequencies simultaneously.
Each receiver listens on a subset of frequencies at a given time.
Protects against $j-1$ colluding receivers, ensuring that each receiver has at least one non-jammed channel.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{[Public] Channel Allocation Table:}
	Defines which channels any receiver should listen on, such that $j-1$ receivers do not cover all channels of any other receiver (set coverage).
	\item \textbf{[Secret] Frequency Allocation Table:}
	Mapping from channel id to frequencies.
	Derived using a PRG.
	The complete table is only known to the base station.
\end{itemize}
%
\underline{Disadvantages}:
effectively a multicast solution since it requires a shared secret between the base station and each receiver.

\paragraph{Based on DSSS}
Dynamic Jamming Mitigation due to Chiang and Hu.
Counteract jamming by using a balanced binary key tree.
\\
Each node in the tree corresponds to a spreading code $C_i$.
Each receiver $N_i$ is assigned a leaf and knows all codes on the path from the root to that leaf.
\\
The base station transmits on (a) a disjoint cover of codes (i.e. all users can decode exactly one code) and (b) a set of test codes.
If a client receives a test code but not the detectable code, it reports jamming.
\\
Splitting and reforming of the tree enables jamming mitigation.

\underline{Disadvantages}:
requires highly flexible, powerful base station.
Requires a feedback channel.
Requires a growing number of shared secrets (and receivers must be known).

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Anti-Jamming---Key-Establishment Dependency}
Above techniques lead to a circular dependency.
We need techniques without shared secrets!
Idea: if we cannot coordinate sender and receiver, then don't even try (see next two techniques).

	\caption{Circular dependency between anti-jamming and key establishment}
	\label{fig:jamming-key-cycle}
\end{figure}

In addition, pre-loading shared keys in full of problems:
requires a trusted party, key revocation, new clients joining, etc.

\paragraph{Uncoordinated Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum UFH}
Neither attacker nor legitimate receivers can predict which channels are used.
Equivalent to FH in terms of jamming protection (but not in throughput).

Transmitter steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Fragment message
	\item Link fragments (against insertion)
	\item Encode packets (ECC against jamming)
	\item Repeated transmission while hopping on frequencies
\end{enumerate}

Receiver steps: same process but reversed (plus packet ordering).
Hops from one frequency to the other (sequentially is fine), in the hope of receiving a fragment.

	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/3-ufh.png}
	\caption{UFH transmitter steps}
	\label{fig:ufh}
\end{figure}

\underline{Issue with fragment linking:} \\
The signature is only verified at the end for the entire message.%
\footnote{The signature is based on public-keys and a mutually trusted -- but potentially offline -- certificate authority CA.}
Since there are exponentially many combinations for re-assembly, the attacker can now perform a DoS on a logical (rather than physical) level (pollution attack).
\\
Solution: cryptographic linking of fragments (but without a shared key).
E.g. hash linking, one-way accumulators, short signatures.

\underline{Disadvantages}:
Throughout up to 1000x less than FH.
Higher latency (depending on attacker strengths, i.e. how high the chances are that the receiver gets a packet).

	\label{fig:ufh-fragment-linking}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Uncoordinates Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum UDSSS}
Neither attacker nor legitimate receivers can predict which spreading codes are used.
The public code set $C$ is composed of $n$ code sequences, each containing $l$ spreading codes.%
\footnote{This allows a message to be fragmented into $l$ pieces.}
Despreading is done by trial-and-error: it requires the correct code sequence and correct synchronisation (which fragment are we at?).
The message is also repeatedly sent because of possible jamming -- possibly in parallel to improve throughput.

\underline{Optimisation}: first transmit the message $M$ with a secret spreading code $K$ using DSSS.
Then transmit the spreading code $K$ using UDSSS.
\\
Advantage: quicker decoding, longer messages, flexible security level.
